# MAE 6291: Internet-of-Things for Engineers (Spring 2025)
## Final Project: IoT Christmas Tree (D. Savarino & N. Janssen)

The IoT Christmas Tree was built and developed for user friendly control of Christmas lights. The code in this repository initializes 50 Raspbery Pi controlled LEDs for a miniature Chrismas tree (although the animations here can always be upscaled!). The light animations use 3D coordinates to generate unqiue patterns and geometries, which can be altered via a Flask application hosted over internet from a Raspberry Pi or similar microcomputer. If connected to an ambient daylight sensor (BH1750 used here), the LED brightness will also adjust to ambient light in real time, improving power consumption. Audio/visual efforts are still a work in progress.
